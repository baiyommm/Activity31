[CIS25] Point Class with Stream Operator Overloading
This C++ program demonstrates the implementation of a Point class in C++ with overloaded stream operators for 
input and output operations. The project is structured with classes and it uses a Function namespace for code organization.

- Overloaded << operator for outputting points in (x, y) format.
- Organized code within the Geometry namespace.
- Modular design with separate header and implementation files.
